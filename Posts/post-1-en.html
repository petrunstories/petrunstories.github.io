         Imagine, you are a third grade student and in a short time you are taking a national
         exam to get into a university in the country. You go on your computer or mobile
         phone, search for the schools and find 5 of them that you think are right for you.
         These schools are named T.E.F.A.A. or S.E.F.A.A. and you go to the websites of each
         one to see the curriculum, what courses you take, etc.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
         You notice that these schools are related to sports science and physical education,
         which leads you, because you like the subjects, to set your sights on getting into a
         T.E.F.A.A. in the country. Then you announce it to your family, friends and teachers
         and one or more of them tell you that you have to take some sports tests.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
         I know you might be a little upset at first, but for now I'm here to answer any
         questions you have about the athletic tests to get into one of the T.E.F.A.A.s in the
         country.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
         There are 4 candidate sports tests and you have to choose 3 of them depending on
         which one you think you will do best and have more familiarity with.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
         Initially it depends on whether you are a student, as there are slight modifications
         depending on gender.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
         If you are a student who will be tested in some of the sports tests for entry to the
         T.E.F.A.A., you have to choose in 3 of the following 4 events: the 200m run in track
         and field, the 4KG shot put, the long jump and the 50m freestyle in swimming.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
         On the other hand, if you are a student who will be tested in some of the sports tests
         for admission to the T.E.F.A.A., you must choose in 3 of the following 4 events: the
         200m track and field run, the 6KG shot put, the long jump and the 50m freestyle in
         swimming.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
         At this point, it is important to mention that the sports tests in today's video are only
         for admission to TEFAA and not for military and police schools where there are
         sports tests there as well. Only there the tests are completely different and the
         evaluation is done in a different way. This is a subject that we will deal with in the
         future.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
         In all the tests the evaluation is based on some norms issued by the Ministry of
         Education and depending on your performance you get a grade from 0 to 20 and the
         maximum grade you can achieve is 4000 points. These norms will be in a link below
         in the description. You then take the scores you have accumulated from all 3 tests, add
         them up and then divide the sum by 3. The quotient of this operation is multiplied by
         200 and the result of this operation is the total points received from the sports tests.
         We add these points to the points we have accumulated from the written tests and thus
         we know how many we have accumulated. Attention however, these points are added
         only for admission to the TEFAA and not to other schools in the country.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
         I know I confused you and you are right. So let's take an example. We have Maria
         who scored 14000 points from the written exam. Maria wants to study sports science
         and physical education and her goal is to study at one of the TEFAA in the country.
         So she chooses to test in 200M, 4KG shot put and 50M freestyle. She performs 34¨10
         in the 200M which corresponds to a grade 11, in the shot put she manages to throw
         8.30m which corresponds to a grade 13 and in the 50M freestyle she achieves a
         performance of 43¨ which corresponds to a grade 6.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
         Since we know our scores from the sports tests, we add 9(200)+13(shot
         put)+8(50k)=30. We divide the number by 3, i.e. 30/3=10. So in the sports tests,
         Maria got a passing score. And to see how many points she finally scored from the
         sports tests we perform the operation 10*200=2000m. So Maria scored 2000 points
         from the sports tests which she will add to the 14000 points from the written tests and
         thus she will have scored 16000 points which will be only for the T.E.F.A.A. of the
         country. While the 14000 points will be for all other colleges and departments.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
         For now with the current system regarding the minimum admission cut-off, Mary has
         to be careful that she has to score a score above that of the average of all the
         candidates multiplied by 0.7. For now such a score is around 4.5-6/20 as a minimum
         admission basis.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
         And this is how Maria and all other national exam candidates will be able to calculate
         the points they can accumulate from the sports tests.
