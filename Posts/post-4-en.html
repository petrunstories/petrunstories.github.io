        <strong style="font-size: 18.5px;">The Fan Culture and Its Roots</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Fan culture is an integral part of the sports spectacle, especially in football. 
        According to Giulianotti (2002), fans are categorized into different groups 
        based on their connection to the team and the way they express their loyalty. 
        Fan identity is not just about the passion for a team, but involves social, 
        political, and cultural factors that influence the dynamics of the stadiums 
        (Davis, 2015).
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Traditionally, fandom is associated with the working class; however, today it 
        includes people from various social strata (Spaaij, 2006; Redhead 2008).  The 
        development of organized clubs and autonomous collectives has created a diverse 
        culture, ranging from team support to participation in social and political 
        movements (Zaimakis, 2022).

      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Violence in stadiums is a phenomenon that cannot be explained solely in terms of 
        sports rivalry.  Young (2012) analyzes the structural contradictions and social 
        problems that are identified behind violence in football, noting that social 
        identity and rivalries are directly linked to violence.  Spaaij and Anderson 
        (2010) emphasize that fan conflicts reflect deeper social tensions and not just 
        superficial sports differences.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        In Greece, violence in stadiums is reinforced by factors such as the lack of trust in 
        institutions, the politicization of fan clubs, and the authorities' inability to 
        effectively control the phenomenon (Zaimakis, 2023).  Characteristic incidents such 
        as the clashes between fans in Nea Filadelfeia in 2023 (Karamiatrou, 2023) and the 
        tragic incident at the volleyball match in Rentis (LIFO, 2023) show that the problem 
        remains intense.

        <strong style="font-size: 18.5px;">How is Violence in Stadiums Addressed?</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Various proposals have been made to address fan violence.  Kerr (1994, 2005) suggests 
        stricter regulation of stadiums, while McPherson, Curtis, and Loy (1989) recommend 
        security measures such as the installation of fences and protective domes for players.  
        At the same time, stricter legislation and the implementation of control mechanisms, 
        such as a fan registry, could help reduce incidents (Taylor, 1982).
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        An alternative approach is the enhancement of fan culture through initiatives such as 
        the creation of archiving centers and libraries dedicated to the history of organized 
        groups (Podaliri &amp; Balesti, 1998).  The social integration of fans, combined with 
        education about the impacts of violence, can constitute a sustainable model of intervention.

        <strong style="font-size: 18.5px;">Conclusion</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Hooligan violence is a complex social phenomenon that requires a multi-faceted approach. 
        The solution does not lie solely in repression, but also in creating a framework that 
        promotes fan identity without the use of violence. With appropriate management, stadiums 
        can remain spaces of expression and passion, without turning into fields of conflict.
