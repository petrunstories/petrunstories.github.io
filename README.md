> ### Overview

Petrun Stories is the 1st Youtube channel in Greece that deals with the science of Sports and Physical Education. The communication of science in Greece through Youtube channels has been booming in recent years. However, sports science and physical education are not adequately represented both on the internet and in the extent to which important concepts penetrate society, often creating misinformation on exercise issues and ¨myths¨ within sports science.
